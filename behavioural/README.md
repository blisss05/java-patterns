#### Behavioral design patterns

Behavioral patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects and how to provide lose coupling and flexibility to extend easily. In these design patterns, **the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.**
That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.

##### There are following 11 types of behavioral design patterns:
1.Chain of responsibility<br/>
_A way of passing a request between a chain of objects._<br/><br/>
2.Command<br/>
_Encapsulate a command request as an object._<br/><br/>
3.Interpreter<br/>
_A way to include language elements in a program._<br/><br/>
4.Iterator<br />
 _Sequentially access the elements of a collection._<br/><br/>
5.Mediator<br />
_Defines simplified communication between classes._<br/><br/>
6.Memento<br />
_Capture and restore an object's internal state._<br/><br/>
7.Observer<br />
_A way of notifying change to a number of classes._<br/><br/>
8.State<br />
_Alter an object's behavior when its state changes_.<br/><br/>
9.Strategy<br />
_Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class._<br/><br/>
10.Template method<br />
_Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass_<br/><br/>
11.Visitor<br />
_Defines a new operation to a class without change._
