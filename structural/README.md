#### Structural design patterns

* Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
* The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.
* These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.

##### There are following 7 types of structural design patterns:

1. Adapter Pattern<br/>
    _Adapting an interface into another according to client expectation._<br/><br/>
2. Bridge Pattern<br/>
    _Separating abstraction (interface) from implementation._<br/><br/>
3. Composite Pattern<br>
    _Allowing clients to operate on hierarchy of objects._<br/><br/>
4. Decorator Pattern<br>
    _Adding functionality to an object dynamically._<br/><br/>
5. Facade Pattern<br/>
    _Providing an interface to a set of interfaces._<br/><br/>
6. Flyweight Pattern<br/>
    _Reusing an object by sharing it._<br/><br/>
7. Proxy Pattern<br/>
    _Representing another object._<br/><br/>
